# Predictive Disease Analysis for Diabetes, Liver Disease, and Breast Cancer

**VitalMap** is a predictive health analytics web application that uses patient vital data to detect the likelihood of three critical diseases: **Diabetes**, **Liver Disease**, and **Breast Cancer**. The system leverages machine learning algorithms including **Decision Tree Classifier**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Random Forest Classifier**, integrated into a user-friendly interface via **Flask**.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Build accurate disease prediction models based on patient vitals.
- Design an intuitive web interface for real-time predictions.
- Use exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns and risk factors.
- Deploy models using Flask for accessibility and ease of use.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Frameworks:** Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Additional Tools:** Joblib, Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm

## 📂 Data Sources

- [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [Breast Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [Liver Disease Dataset (30K)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## 📈 Outcome

This project delivers a deployable prediction system that can aid in early disease detection using vital statistics. The solution promotes health awareness and demonstrates how data science can support preventive healthcare.
